# Data Structures

This repository hosts a collection of the internal implementations of essential data structures in computer science. From basic linear structures like Linked Lists to advanced hierarchical trees and hash tables, this repository provides a comprehensive toolkit for understanding, implementing, and utilizing fundamental data structures in your projects.

## What's Inside?

- **Vector:** A dynamic array offering efficient insertion, deletion, and access to elements.
- **Singly Linked List**: Linear structure where each element points to the next.
- **Doubly Linked List:** Similar to a singly linked list, but with bidirectional links.
- **Sparse Array and Matrix:** Efficient storage and access for arrays and matrices with many default values.
- **Stack:** Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure for managing data.
- **Queue:** First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure for managing data.
- **Binary Tree:** Hierarchical structure with at most two children per node.
- **Binary Search Tree:** Binary tree with efficient searching capabilities.
- **Binary Heap:** Tree-based structure satisfying the heap property, useful for priority queues.
- **AVL Tree:** Self-balancing binary search tree ensuring logarithmic time complexity for operations.
- **Letter Tree (Trie):** Tree-like structure for storing a dynamic set of strings with shared prefixes.
- **Hash Table:** Data structure for implementing associative arrays based on hash functions.
- **Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree):** A tree-like data structure for efficiently performing range sum queries and updates in logarithmic time.
