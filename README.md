# Data Structures

This repository hosts a curated collection of fundamental data structures implemented from scratch. From foundational linear structures to advanced trees and hash-based structures, this repository serves as a resource for understanding the inner workings of key data structures in computer science.

## What's Inside

### [Vector](./Vector)
A dynamic array that supports random access and amortized constant-time insertions at the end.

### [Linked List](./LinkedList)
Sequential structures where elements point to the next (and optionally previous) node.
- **Singly Linked List** – nodes linked in one direction.
- **Doubly Linked List** – nodes linked in both directions.

### [Sparse Array and Matrix](./Sparse%20Array%20and%20Matrix)
Memory-efficient structures for representing arrays and matrices with many zero or default values.

### [Stack](./Stack)
A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure used for backtracking, parsing, and more.

### [Queue](./Queue)
A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure useful in scheduling and buffering systems.

### [Binary Tree](./Binary%20Tree)
A hierarchical structure where each node has up to two children.

### [Binary Search Tree](./Binary%20Search%20Tree)
A binary tree where the left child is less than the node, and the right child is greater — enables fast lookups, insertions, and deletions.

### [Binary Heap](./Binary%20Heap)
A complete binary tree used for priority queues that maintains the heap property.

### [AVL Tree](./AVL%20Tree)
A self-balancing binary search tree that maintains height balance to ensure O(log n) operations.

### [Letter Tree (Trie)](./Letter%20Tree%20(Trie))
A prefix tree that supports fast insertion and lookup of strings with shared prefixes.

### [Hash Table](./Hash%20Table)
A structure that maps keys to values using a hash function — supports average-case constant-time operations.

### [Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree)](./Binary%20Indexed%20Tree)
A compact tree-like structure for efficiently computing prefix sums and handling updates in logarithmic time.

### [Segment Tree](./Segment%20Tree)
A binary tree used for range queries and updates in logarithmic time.  
- **Range Sum Query** – efficiently computes sum over a range.
- **Range Minimum Query** – finds the minimum element in a range.
- **Range Maximum Query** – finds the maximum element in a range.
